== Getting started

=== Running the service
OAuth2 Example is written using http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot[Spring Boot] which
makes it easy to get it up and running so that you can start exploring the REST API.

The first step is to clone the Git repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/McNullty/oauth2-example
----

Once the clone is complete, you're ready to get the service up and running:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd oauth2-example
$ ./mvnw clean package
$ java -jar target/oauth2-example.jar
----

You can check that the service is up and running by executing a simple request using
cURL: 

TODO: Come back with examples when all end points are described.

responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
from resource to resource.
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
